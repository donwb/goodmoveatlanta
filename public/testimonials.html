                        What a great experience we had with Traci Browning!  My family and I had a short amount of time to find a house in metro Atlanta.  I had never been to this area before and was nervous about finding the right neighborhood and home for my family.  Traci dedicated her time to us during our short visit and helped us identify the area in which we wanted to live.  She negotiated and moved very fast to ensure we had a contract at the end of the week.  It didn't end there!  Traci went out of her way to help us get our house ready to move into.  She worked with contractors and vendors while we were relocating so everything was ready when we arrived.  I can't say enough positive things about Traci.  Anyone would be lucky to work with her!

                        We had a few setbacks with the market and Traci stuck with it and continued to search for homes that matched our criteria.

She took great photos and held several open houses.  We received many call backs even after we took the property off the market.  Traci is a very understanding agent who explains everything in detail.  We will definitely refer her to others and when we do decided to move will give her a call.

                        Recently, my wife and I decided to make the leap into purchasing a new home. Thankfully, we were introduced to Traci Browning of Maximum One Realtors. Looking back, I could not have made a better decision. Traci was key for both listing and marketing our home and locating our new home. We not only sold our home within 30 days, but it sold for the same amount which she suggested we should list for which saved us a great deal of time and aggravation. Moreover, she was able to navigate us through the purchase and negotiation of our new home. I will always refer Traci to my friends and family and have gained a friend through this process.
