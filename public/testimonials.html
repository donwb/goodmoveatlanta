                        Working with Traci was our privilege. Her sense of our needs was spot on and we couldnt be more happy in our present location. Her calm and reassurance in dealing with closing deadlines was exactly what we needed.

                        I've had the pleasure of working with Traci Browning when I found my home and she was absolutely amazing. She is very patient, dependable, and she follows through whether it's an email, text message, or phone call and gets the job done. For that alone she gets an A+++. I have referred her to at least 5 other people and they also love her as much as I do. Traci is definitely the person for you if you're looking to purchase or even looking to rent. She will find you a perfect home that fits your needs and budget. I love her!!! :)

                        A few months ago, I decided I wanted to make the move from Buford to Decatur. Traci Browning was referred to me by a friend who also used her to find their house. Traci took up lots of time and made me feel very relaxed! Finally we found the perfect home for me. Even after the deal was done, Traci took the time to be sure I was happy in my new home. Because of Traci, the whole "finding a house experience" was a breeze!
